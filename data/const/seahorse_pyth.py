        Validate the price account - checks the pubkey against the known Pyth price pubkey list.

        Without checking the account key against a known Pyth key, you can not guarantee that the account actually comes from Pyth. Therefore, this step is mandatory, otherwise your program would be at risk of an easy exploit.

        The `product` parameter must be a string literal with the following format: `[cluster-]BASE/QUOTE`. The cluster is optional, and defaults to mainnet.

        For example, mainnet SOL/USD is just 'SOL/USD'. Devnet USD/JPY is 'devnet-USD/JPY'.

        @param product: The symbol of the product whose price you want. Must be a string literal in the format discussed above.
