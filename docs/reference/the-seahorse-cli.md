# The Seahorse CLI

Usage:

* **seahorse init \<project\_name>**: Initialize a new Seahose project.
* **seahorse build**: Build your Seahorse project - compiles your code and invokes `anchor build` to generate an executable.
* **seahorse compile \<file>**: Compile a Seahorse file in order to easily inspect the generated Rust code.
* **seahorse update**: Replace your old **prelude.py** file with the current one, if your CLI has been updated recently.
